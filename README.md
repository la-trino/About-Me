# About-Me
Get to know me a little more!

I'm Trinidad Cornejo, a 26 years old Journalist and Motion Designer based in Santiago, Chile.

I currently work as an Audiovisual Designer at Reactor, a strategic communications agency based in Santiago, and as a professor of the course _Nonfiction Graphic Narrative_, at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. 

I am passionate about telling stories using different languages and formats. I'm on GitHub to get to know the platform and get closer to collaborative work with programming languages.
